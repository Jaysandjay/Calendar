# ðŸ“… School Calendar

I created this simplified calendar to keep track of assignments for my classes while attending **Humber Polytechnic College**.  
I decided to build it using the **Vue** framework along with **Vuetify** so I could learn and gain hands-on experience working with modern web technologies.

I first tried to implement VCalendar - a calendar a date picker plugin for Vue.js.
